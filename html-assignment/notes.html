             <h2>5 HTML tags</h2>
             <dl>
                 <dt>Image tag</dt>
                 <dd>The image tag is a singular tag (self-closing) and requires the following attributes: "src" source, to provide the relative or absolute path to the image and "alt" alternate text, to provide description of the image for search engines, screen readers and in case the image does not load.</dd>
                 <dt>Anchor tag</dt>
                 <dd>Anchor's are how we link to websites, specific pages, photos, documents or any other resource available on the web or on our web server. The anchor tag is a paired tag and the content we want to display as a link is added between the opening a and the closing a. For providing the location where the anchor tag will link-to we use the href attribute.</dd>
                 <dt>Div</dt>
                 <dd>Div is a paired tag that defines a division or section in an HTML document. It is used as a container for HTML elements, which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. </dd>
                 <dt>Heading tags</dt>
                 <dd>Headings are paired tags that are used for identifying headings on the page. They range from h1 (biggest size) to h6 (smallest size) and the browser will style each heading according to their level.</dd>
                 <dt>Generic tags</dt>
                 <dd>There are two main generic tags we use in HTML: "div" and "span" which are both paired tags. These tags are mainly used to wrap around any content when we do not want to give any semantic meaning to the content but need a parent to style the content or add interactivity using JavaScript. Div is used to wrap around multiple child elements and divides the content into logical groups which show the content on a separate line. Span is used for single elements or short piece of content. Span shows the content inline with the rest of the content.</dd>
