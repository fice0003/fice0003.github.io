                Namaste. My name is Jennifer, but please call me <strong>Jen</strong>. I was born and raised in Ottawa, so I’m a champ at handling winter weather. In fact, when I was in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, my first driving test was done during a snowstorm (no biggie). I’m not really into winter sports, except for cross-country skiing. <br>
                I have spent the last decade without any clear direction on a career path and have worked in many different roles and industries. I am interested in a career where I can be creative, work remotely, and not be stuck in a mundane routine. This is why I have chosen the <em>Interactive Media Design Program</em>. 
               <p>One of my favorite quotes:<br>
                <blockquote>
                    “Beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity” <cite>-Plato</cite>
